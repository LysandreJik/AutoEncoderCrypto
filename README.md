# AutoEncoderCrypto
Using an auto-encoder to crypt and decrypt data and share it with your friends in a private manner.

The algorithm uses a Diffie-Hellman key-exchange to set the same seed on both networks.

The same seed provides the same weights in the training allowing for an encryption and decryption based on it.
